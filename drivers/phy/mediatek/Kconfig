	  Say 'Y' here to add support for MediaTek T-PHY driver,
	  it supports multiple usb2.0, usb3.0 ports, PCIe and
	  SATA, and meanwhile supports two version T-PHY which have
	  different banks layout, the T-PHY with shared banks between
	  multi-ports is first version, otherwise is second version,
	  so you can easily distinguish them by banks layout.

config PHY_MTK_UFS

	  Support for UFS M-PHY on MediaTek chipsets.
	  Enable this to provide vendor-specific probing,
	  initialization, power on and power off flow of
	  specified M-PHYs.

config PHY_MTK_XSPHY

	help
	  Enable this to support the SuperSpeedPlus XS-PHY transceiver for
	  USB3.1 GEN2 controllers on MediaTek chips. The driver supports
	  multiple USB2.0, USB3.1 GEN2 ports.

	depends on ARCH_MEDIATEK && OF
	select GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  Enable this to support for Mediatek USB 3.0 PHY I2c Interface driver,
	  MTK MD1122, MS0796 and so on.

	  It supports multiple usb 2.0 and usb 3.0 ports.
	  This i2c interface is internal bus special for Medaitek USB 3.0
	  PHY transceiver. In general, these daughter card is used
	  to develop or verify usb feature in FPGA environment.

	select PHY_MTK_USB3_I2C_FPGA
	help
	  Enable this to add support the transceiver that is Mediatek USB 2.0
	  MD1122 PHY daughter board driver with chip AT60810AG.

	  This driver controls the entire PHY block usb 2.0 PHYs.
	  And we use xHCI IP MAC module that MTK customered.

	depends on ARCH_MEDIATEK || COMPILE_TEST
	depends on OF
	select GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  Support DisplayPort PHY for Mediatek SoCs.
